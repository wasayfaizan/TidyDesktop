# TidyDesktop
This Python script helps you keep your desktop clean and organized by automatically sorting files into designated folders based on their file types. It moves PDFs to a "PDFs" folder, images to an "Images" folder, and all other files to an "Others" folder. Simply run the script to declutter your desktop in seconds.
